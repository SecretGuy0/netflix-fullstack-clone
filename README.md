# netflix-fullstack-clone
My first ever fullstack project. Made by me with help of one person. It's based on a Netflix and have SOME of its features.
Here you can see how API, typescript, taiwindCSS, NodeJS works and learn some basic code to start creating your first site.
This code is created at May 2023, so if you seeing this later, you may have features that can ease you creation of this project.
Current repository will be improved with time until all available features could be used.
When you add project to vercel make sure that code is not in folder like here because it may have issues.
